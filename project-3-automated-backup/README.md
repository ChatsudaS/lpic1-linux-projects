# Project 3: Automated Backup Script

## Overview
This Bash script automates backups by compressing the contents of `~/important-files` into a timestamped archive in `~/backups`.

## How to Use
1. Put files you want to back up in `~/important-files`.
2. Run:

./backup_script.sh

3. Archive appears in `~/backups/` with the current date/time in the filename.

## Example Output

Backup completed successfully!
Backup file created at: /home/username/backups/backup_20251111_152300.tar.gz
